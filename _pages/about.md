Hello, my name is Wang Peiji. I am currently a master's student of the 27th cohort at Zhejiang University. Before this, I obtained a bachelor's degree in engineering from Zhejiang University in 2024.

During my undergraduate studies, I was passionate about low-level development related to robotics and embedded systems. During my master's, I primarily focused on research in model-based mobile robot planning and control, and I also have some understanding of 3D vision. At the same time, I have a great passion and interest in embodied AI. I have tried out the Qwen series models as well as VLA models like pi0, pi0-fast, pi0.5, and smolvla. I believe that robot memory systems and CoT, the expression of physical mechanisms contained in world models, transferable implicit action layers, and robot systems driven by both data and models will all be topics I will be thinking about for a long time to come. 
Embodied AI is both dreamy and exciting!
